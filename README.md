Tim's Notes

This is my portfolio page using the Bootstrap theme Creative. I removed multiple, non-relevant sections (at least at this point). For instance, the services section of the page. I have added my own profile information, a profile picture, added links to my Github, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow, created additional portfolio placeholder pages.
